## 📈 Scalability Planning

### Traffic Growth Handling

#### Cloud Platforms
- **Low Traffic** (1-1000 daily users): All platforms handle easily
- **Medium Traffic** (1000-10000 daily users): Netlify/Vercel excel
- **High Traffic** (10000+ daily users): May require paid plans

#### Raspberry Pi
- **Pi 3 B+**: Up to 5-10 concurrent users
- **Pi 4 (2GB)**: Up to 10-15 concurrent users  
- **Pi 4 (4GB+)**: Up to 20-30 concurrent users
- **Multiple Pis**: Can load balance for higher capacity

### Scaling Strategies

#### Cloud Scaling
```
Small → Medium → Large
Free tier → Paid plan → Enterprise
```

#### Pi Scaling
```
Single Pi → Load Balanced Pis → Hybrid Cloud
Pi 3 → Pi 4 → Cluster → Move to cloud
```

## 💰 Cost Analysis (5 Year Projection)

### Cloud Hosting Costs
```
GitHub Pages: $0 (free tier)
Netlify Pro: $19/month × 60 = $1,140
Vercel Pro: $20/month × 60 = $1,200
```

### Raspberry Pi Costs
```
Initial hardware: $110
Electricity (5 years): $180 ($3/month)
Total: $290
SD card replacements: $30
Total 5-year cost: ~$320
```

**Break-even point**: Pi pays for itself in ~6-8 months vs paid cloud plans
