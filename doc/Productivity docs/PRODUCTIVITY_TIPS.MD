# TaxiTub - Productivity Tips

1. Always create small, testable modules.
2. Keep API contracts stable (don’t rename endpoints unless necessary).
3. Use CHANGELOG.MD after every update — no exceptions.
4. Commit often, push daily. Use feature branches:
   - feature/admin-crud
   - feature/queuepal-flow
   - feature/passenger-booking
5. Run tests before merging into main.
6. Use AI Agent only with Docs context → no hallucinations.
7. Never hardcode secrets (use .env for Supabase keys).
