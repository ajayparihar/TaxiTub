## Part 3: Verification and Testing

### Step 7: Monitor Deployment
1. Go to your repository's **"Actions"** tab
2. You should see a workflow running: **"Deploy TaxiTub to GitHub Pages"**
3. Click on it to monitor the progress
4. Wait for both "build" and "deploy" jobs to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

### Step 8: Access Your Live Application
1. Once deployment is successful, go to **"Settings"** â†’ **"Pages"**
2. You'll see your site URL: `https://ajayparihar.github.io/Delhi-Cabs/`
3. Click the URL to access your live application
4. Test the key features:
   - Admin dashboard should load
   - Try adding a car
   - Test the queue management
   - Verify passenger booking works

### Step 9: Test Database Connection
1. In your live application, try to:
   - Add a new car (Admin role)
   - Add car to queue (QueuePal role)  
   - Book a taxi (Passenger role)
2. If everything works, your database is properly connected!

## Part 4: Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file with your Supabase credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Making Updates
1. Make your code changes locally
2. Test thoroughly with `npm run dev`
3. Commit and push to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your update description"
git push origin main
```
4. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your changes

## Part 5: Maintenance and Monitoring

### Regular Tasks
- **Weekly**: Check your Supabase dashboard for database usage
- **Monthly**: Review GitHub Actions usage (free tier has limits)

- Check the Actions tab for error logs
- Verify your repository secrets are set correctly
- Ensure no syntax errors in your code

#### 2. Application Loads But Features Don't Work
- Check browser console for errors
