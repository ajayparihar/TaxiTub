- **FIFO Positioning:** Perfect consecutive positioning (no gaps)
- **Queue Addition:** Successfully added cars to appropriate queues
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Correctly prevented same car from being queued twice
- **Cross-Queue Management:** Different seater types properly isolated

**Queue Analysis:**
- Position integrity maintained: `[2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 35]` - Consecutive ‚úÖ
- Queue isolation working correctly
- Automatic position calculation functioning

### 4. Booking/Assignment Logic ‚úÖ
- **Taxi Assignment:** Successfully assigned 4-seater taxi for 2 passengers
- **Efficiency Calculation:** 50% efficiency (2/4 seats) - optimal for small groups
- **Queue Removal:** Car properly removed from queue after assignment
- **Business Rules:** Passenger count validation (1-8 passengers) implemented

**Assignment Test:**
```
Assigned: DL81KK8139 (4-seater taxi)
Passengers: 2
Efficiency: 50% (2/4 seats)
Queue Position: Removed successfully
```

### 5. QueuePal Management CRUD Operations ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **READ:** Successfully found 3 existing QueuePals
- **UPDATE:** Not tested due to creation failure
- **DELETE:** Not tested due to creation failure
- **CREATE:** ‚ùå Failed due to schema issue

**Issue Identified:**
```
Error: Could not find the 'assignedby' column of 'queuepal' in the schema cache
```

**Root Cause:** Database schema mismatch - the column name may be different than expected.

### 6. Business Logic & Edge Cases ‚úÖ
- **Invalid Operations:** Correctly handled invalid car IDs
- **Data Consistency:** Queue positions remain consecutive
- **Error Handling:** Proper error messages and codes
- **Validation Logic:** Input sanitization working

**API Test Results:**
```
GET /carinfo?select=carid,plateno,seater&limit=3
Response: 3 records returned successfully
Headers: Proper authentication
Status: 200 OK
```

## üêõ ISSUES FOUND

### 1. QueuePal Schema Issue (Minor)
- **Severity:** Low
- **Impact:** QueuePal creation functionality affected
- **Status:** One test failed
- **Recommendation:** Verify database schema for `queuepal` table column names

**Possible Solutions:**
1. Check if column is named `assigned_by` instead of `assignedby`
2. Verify column exists in database schema
3. Update API service to match actual database schema
